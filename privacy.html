            <h3>3. How We Share Your Information</h3>
            <p>
                We may share your personal information with third parties in the following circumstances:
            </p>

            <h4>3.1. With Your Consent</h4>
            <p>
                We may share your information with third parties when you give us explicit consent to do so. For example, if you choose to connect your Yumckify account with a third-party social media service, you authorize us to share information with that service.
            </p>

            <h4>3.2. With Service Providers</h4>
            <p>
                We engage third-party service providers to perform functions on our behalf and help us operate our business. These service providers have access to personal information only as needed to perform their functions and are contractually obligated to maintain the confidentiality and security of your information. Examples include:
            </p>
            <ul>

            <h4>3.3. For Business Transfers</h4>
            <p>
                In the event that Yumckify is involved in a merger, acquisition, reorganization, sale of assets, or bankruptcy, your personal information may be transferred as part of that transaction. We will notify you via email and/or a prominent notice on our Site of any such change in ownership or control of your personal information.
            </p>

            <h4>3.4. For Legal Reasons and Protection</h4>
            <p>
                We may disclose your information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Comply with a legal obligation (e.g., court order, subpoena).</li>
                <li>Protect and defend the rights or property of Yumckify.</li>
                <li>Prevent or investigate possible wrongdoing in connection with the Site.</li>
                <li>Protect the personal safety of users of the Site or the public.</li>
                <li>Protect against legal liability.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>3.5. Aggregated or Anonymized Data</h4>
            <p>
                We may share aggregated or anonymized information that cannot reasonably be used to identify you. This type of information is used for various purposes, including research, analytics, and improving our services. For example, we might share aggregated data about popular recipe categories or user engagement trends with partners.
            </p>

            <h3>4. Cookies and Tracking Technologies</h3>
            <p>
                As mentioned, we use cookies and similar tracking technologies to collect and use personal information about you. For detailed information about how we use cookies, what types of cookies we use, and how you can manage your cookie preferences, please refer to our dedicated <a href="cookies.html">Cookies Policy</a>. This policy explains the role of cookies in enhancing your browsing experience, remembering your preferences, and enabling certain functionalities of the Site. It also covers how we use web beacons, pixels, and other technologies for analytics and advertising purposes.
            </p>

            <h3>5. Data Security</h3>
            <p>
                The security of your personal information is paramount to us. We implement a variety of technical and organizational measures designed to protect your information from unauthorized access, use, alteration, or destruction. These measures include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Encryption:</strong> We use industry-standard encryption (e.g., SSL/TLS) to protect data transmitted between your browser and our servers.</li>
                <li><strong>Access Controls:</strong> Access to personal information is restricted to authorized personnel who need the information to perform their job functions.</li>
                <li><strong>Regular Security Audits:</strong> We regularly review our security practices and systems to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Minimization:</strong> We only collect personal information that is necessary for the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Storage:</strong> Personal information is stored on secure servers with robust security features.</li>
                <li><strong>Incident Response Plan:</strong> We have procedures in place to respond to potential data breaches or security incidents promptly and effectively.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Despite our best efforts, no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your personal information. You also play a crucial role in protecting your data by choosing a strong, unique password for your Yumckify account and keeping it confidential. Do not share your password with anyone. If you suspect any unauthorized access to your account, please contact us immediately.
            </p>

            <h3>6. Your Data Protection Rights</h3>
            <p>
                Depending on your location and applicable data protection laws (such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Union or the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) in California), you may have certain rights regarding your personal information. These rights may include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Right to Access:</strong> You have the right to request a copy of the personal information we hold about you.</li>
                <li><strong>Right to Rectification:</strong> You have the right to request that we correct any inaccurate or incomplete personal information we hold about you.</li>
                <li><strong>Right to Erasure ("Right to Be Forgotten"):</strong> In certain circumstances, you have the right to request the deletion of your personal information.</li>
                <li><strong>Right to Restrict Processing:</strong> You have the right to request that we restrict the processing of your personal information in certain situations.</li>
                <li><strong>Right to Data Portability:</strong> You have the right to receive your personal information in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format and to transmit that data to another controller, where technically feasible.</li>
                <li><strong>Right to Object:</strong> You have the right to object to the processing of your personal information in certain circumstances, including for direct marketing purposes.</li>
                <li><strong>Right to Withdraw Consent:</strong> Where we rely on your consent to process your personal information, you have the right to withdraw that consent at any time. This will not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal.</li>
                <li><strong>Right to Lodge a Complaint:</strong> You have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority if you believe your data protection rights have been violated.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                To exercise any of these rights, please contact us using the contact details provided in the "Contact Us" section below. We will respond to your request in accordance with applicable law. We may need to verify your identity before fulfilling your request.
            </p>

            <h3>7. Children's Privacy</h3>
            <p>
                Yumckify is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we become aware that we have collected personal information from a child under 13 without verifiable parental consent, we will take steps to delete that information as quickly as possible. If you are a parent or guardian and believe that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us.
            </p>
            <p>
                For users between the ages of 13 and 16, we encourage parental involvement and supervision. We advise young users to obtain parental consent before providing any personal information online. Our content is generally family-friendly, but certain interactive features or community aspects may be more suitable for older audiences. We are committed to creating a safe online environment for all our users.
            </p>

            <h3>8. Third-Party Websites and Services</h3>
            <p>
                Our Site may contain links to third-party websites or services that are not operated by us. We have no control over, and assume no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services. We strongly advise you to review the privacy policy of every site you visit. The inclusion of any link does not imply endorsement by Yumckify.
            </p>
            <p>
                For example, if you click on an advertisement or a link to a product in our "Shop the Yum" section, you will be directed to a third-party e-commerce site. Your interactions on those sites are governed by their respective privacy policies and terms of service. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such third-party websites.
            </p>

            <h3>9. International Data Transfers</h3>
            <p>
                Your information, including personal information, may be transferred to — and maintained on — computers located outside of your state, province, country, or other governmental jurisdiction where the data protection laws may differ from those of your jurisdiction.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you are located outside of the country where our servers are located and choose to provide information to us, please note that we transfer the data, including personal information, to that country and process it there. Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by your submission of such information represents your agreement to that transfer.
            </p>
            <p>
                We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy and no transfer of your personal information will take place to an organization or a country unless there are adequate controls in place including the security of your data and other personal information. This includes implementing standard contractual clauses or other appropriate safeguards where required by law.
            </p>

            <h3>10. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h3>
            <p>
                We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this Privacy Policy. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
            </p>
            <p>
                For significant changes, we may provide you with additional notice, such as through email or a prominent notice on our Site. Your continued use of the Site after any modifications to this Privacy Policy will constitute your acknowledgment of the modifications and your consent to abide and be bound by the modified Privacy Policy.
            </p>

            <h3>11. Data Retention</h3>
            <p>
                We retain personal information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements. To determine the appropriate retention period for personal information, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal information, the purposes for which we process your personal information and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.
            </p>
            <p>
                When we no longer need to process your personal information for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy, we will either delete or anonymize it. If this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.
            </p>

            <h3>12. Your Choices and Controls</h3>
            <h4>12.1. Opting Out of Marketing Communications</h4>
            <p>
                You can opt-out of receiving promotional or marketing emails from us at any time by following the unsubscribe instructions provided in those emails or by contacting us directly. Please note that even if you opt-out of marketing communications, we may still send you non-promotional communications, such as those about your account, transactions, or our ongoing business relations.
            </p>
            <h4>12.2. Cookie Preferences</h4>
            <p>
                Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove or reject browser cookies. Please note that if you choose to remove or reject cookies, this could affect the availability and functionality of our Site. For more details, see our <a href="cookies.html">Cookies Policy</a>.
            </p>
            <h4>12.3. Do Not Track Signals</h4>
            <p>
                Some web browsers may transmit "Do Not Track" (DNT) signals to websites with which the browser communicates. Because there is not yet a common understanding of how to interpret DNT signals, we do not currently respond to DNT signals from browsers.
            </p>

            <h3>13. Specific Jurisdictional Disclosures (Examples)</h3>
            <h4>13.1. For Users in the European Economic Area (EEA) and UK</h4>
            <p>
                If you are a resident of the EEA or UK, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) provides you with specific rights regarding your personal data. Yumckify acts as a "data controller" for the personal data collected through the Site. Our legal bases for collecting and using the personal information described in this Privacy Policy depend on the personal information we collect and the specific context in which we collect it. We may process your personal information because:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>We need to perform a contract with you (e.g., to provide services you requested).</li>
                <li>You have given us explicit permission to do so.</li>
                <li>The processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your rights (e.g., for security, analytics, or service improvement).</li>
                <li>To comply with the law.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                You have the right to complain to a data protection authority about our collection and use of your personal information. For more information, please contact your local data protection authority in the EEA or the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) in the UK.
            </p>

            <h4>13.2. For California Residents (CCPA)</h4>
            <p>
                If you are a California resident, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) grants you specific rights regarding your personal information. This section supplements the information contained in the rest of our Privacy Policy and applies solely to visitors, users, and others who reside in the State of California.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Right to Know:</strong> You have the right to request that we disclose what personal information we collect, use, disclose, and sell.</li>
                <li><strong>Right to Delete:</strong> You have the right to request the deletion of your personal information collected or maintained by us, subject to certain exceptions.</li>
                <li><strong>Right to Opt-Out of Sale:</strong> Yumckify does not sell your personal information. We do not disclose personal information to third parties for monetary or other valuable consideration.</li>
                <li><strong>Right to Non-Discrimination:</strong> You have the right not to receive discriminatory treatment for exercising any of your CCPA rights.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                To exercise your CCPA rights, please submit a verifiable consumer request to us by contacting us via the details in the "Contact Us" section. Only you, or a person registered with the California Secretary of State that you authorize to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable consumer request related to your personal information. The verifiable consumer request must:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative.</li>
                <li>Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you. We will only use personal information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor's identity or authority to make the request.
            </p>
